# Tournament Management System – The Lighthouse Schools

This project was created as part of the **Requirements Engineering** course at Saxion University of Applied Sciences (April 2025).  
The goal of this assignment was to design and document a complete system for managing sports tournaments between special education schools.

## Project Summary

The Lighthouse Schools organize annual tournaments for sports such as soccer, korfball, and volleyball.  
They needed a system that helps them manage the entire process — from team registration to live standings during the event.

The system was designed to:

- Register teams automatically  
- Generate game schedules  
- Allow the tournament director to enter results easily  
- Update standings and next matches based on results  
- Display live standings on a big screen  

This project focused on analyzing user needs, defining functional and non-functional requirements, and creating detailed documentation for system design.

## What I Did

- Read and analyzed the client’s request letter  
- Defined clear system requirements and specifications  
- Designed the system architecture and workflows  
- Created functional and non-functional design documents  
- Prepared use cases, diagrams, and backlog items  
- Built a small working prototype to demonstrate the core idea  
- Presented the final report and presentation to the client

## Files Included

- **Client Letter** – Original request from the customer  
- **Requirements Document** – System and user requirements  
- **Functional Design (PDF/Word)** – Detailed functional description  
- **Backlog (CSV/PDF)** – Product backlog and user stories  
- **Test Report** – Verification of requirements and functionality  
- **Presentation (PPTX)** – Final project presentation  
- **Prototypes Folder** – Early visual mockups of the system

## Course Context

In the Requirements Engineering course, we learned how to collect, write, and validate requirements for ICT systems.  
The course focuses on preventing the common problem where developers start coding before fully understanding what the client wants.

By using structured methods, we learned to:

- Identify and communicate with stakeholders  
- Gather and document requirements clearly  
- Design functional and quality specifications  
- Validate requirements through testing and prototyping  
- Report and present findings in a professional format
